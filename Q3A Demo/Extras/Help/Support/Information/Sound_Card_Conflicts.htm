<p>If you purchased your sound card before the release of
Windows 95, you may obtain updated drivers from a variety of places. Most hardware
retailers have access to the most recent drivers. Additionally, most manufacturers
maintain a website, which contains the latest drivers for free downloading. Drivers are
also available on CompuServe, America Online, The Microsoft Network, and other popular
online networks. Many manufacturers also maintain a direct-dial BBS with up-to-date
drivers. A list of <a href="../vendor/Sound_Card_Manufacturers_List.htm">Sound Card Manufacturers</a> and their
Technical Support and BBS numbers is available in this document. Please make every effort
to install the latest drivers before calling <a href="../Customer%20Support/Customer_Support.htm">Activision
Customer Support</a>.</p>
